# Households and Householding

## What are Households?

Households are a core feature that help you organize and manage related contacts. A household represents a group of people who are financially connected and typically make financial decisions together.

## How Households Work

### Creating Households

Households are automatically created when you add a new Lead to the system. The Lead becomes the primary member of the new household.

### Household Structure

Each household consists of:
- **Members**: Individuals who belong to the household
- **Family**: The family structure within the household, showing relationships
- **Financial Records**: Shared financial information, accounts, and assets
- **Client Service History**: Tracking of interactions and meetings with household members

## Family Relationships

Within a household, members can have different roles:
- **Head of Household**: The primary decision maker(s)
- **Members**: Other household participants (like children)

Family relationships can be defined between members, such as:
- Spouse or significant other
- Parent-child relationships
- Other family connections
